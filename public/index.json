Due to its importance, the cohort size is significant, with approximately 700 students each year. To ensure better class engagement, the class size is kept small, with around eight students per class. Consequently, the module requires a large number of Teaching Assistants to support the students effectively. The professors open a recruitment portal to select the Teaching Assistants for CS1101S, distinguishing it from the application process of many other modules. üéì Application Procedure The TA recruitment portal typically opens around November and December. Besides basic personal particulars, the application requires candidates to elaborate on the characteristics of a good teaching assistant and the personal qualities they possess that make them suitable for the role. After the application submission, the professors arrange interview sessions in the subsequent semester for shortlisted candidates. üìù The Interview The interview usually takes place from January to April in the second semester. The interview is quite formal and aims to test the candidates‚Äô ability to express themselves clearly and their comprehension of CS1101S concepts. The professor may act as a confusing student and ask the candidates to explain various concepts, such as recursion, environment model, time complexity, and more. üí¨ üí° Unexpected Questions: During the interview, the professor might ask unexpected conceptual questions. For instance, I was asked about the difference between a statement and an expression, a seemingly straightforward yet often overlooked distinction. ü§î The interview typically lasts for about half an hour, and the passing rate is generally high. It is essential to note that an A- grade in CS1101S does not hinder one from getting an offer as a Teaching Assistant. üéØ ","date":"2022-11-14","objectID":"/posts/ta/ta/:0:2","tags":["computer science"],"title":"My Experience as a Teaching Assistant in the School of Computing","uri":"/posts/ta/ta/"},{"categories":["Academia"],"content":"Workload and Responsibilities The workload as a Teaching Assistant varies depending on one‚Äôs familiarity with the module‚Äôs content and preferred teaching style. It primarily consists of three aspects: conducting lessons, preparing lessons, and grading homework. üìö Conducting Lessons: There is a 2-hour tutorial session every week. During the session, I typically start with a lecture recap for around 20-30 minutes, followed by students discussing their homework among themselves. Next, I provide an in-class worksheet for them to solve on the spot, with the remaining time dedicated to explaining the solutions. The workload of conducting lessons is generally manageable, especially when actively guiding the students through most of the content. However, some Teaching Assistants prefer to adopt a more hands-off approach and encourage students to engage more actively in discussions. üéí Preparing Lessons: The workload of preparing lessons is surprisingly significant. Being able to teach effectively requires a deeper understanding of the subject matter than simply knowing the concepts. As a result, I formed a small group with four friends who also became TAs for this module. We met every Friday to plan our lessons, discuss challenging concepts, and create slides for the upcoming tutorials. Instead of starting from scratch, we adapted slides from the previous batch of TAs and adjusted them to fit the modifications in the syllabus. üìä Grading Homework: Grading homework requires a great deal of patience, as CS1101S is an introductory module, and many students have little to no programming experience. The coding style of their homework can be quite messy, and some students lack the habit of commenting their code, making it challenging to understand their solutions. However, as the semester progresses, students become more familiar with coding and computer science, which improves the grading experience. üìù To summarize, being a Teaching Assistant for CS1101S can be compared to taking a challenging module in terms of workload and responsibilities. üíº ","date":"2022-11-14","objectID":"/posts/ta/ta/:0:3","tags":["computer science"],"title":"My Experience as a Teaching Assistant in the School of Computing","uri":"/posts/ta/ta/"},{"categories":["Academia"],"content":"Insights and Skills Gained Being a Teaching Assistant provided me with valuable experiences and insights: üåü Reinforced Understanding of Fundamental CS Concepts: As a TA, I discovered that my understanding of certain concepts from the previous year was not as comprehensive as I had thought.

Balancing subarrays effectively requires careful consideration of the array elements and their occurrences. With potentially large input arrays, the sheer number of subarrays possible demands a well-thought-out algorithmic approach. Additionally, ensuring that each subarray meets the condition of having elements occurring an even number of times, including zero occurrences, poses an intriguing challenge. To achieve the O(n^2) time complexity, we need to devise an algorithm that efficiently explores the array and identifies balanced subarrays without unnecessary computations. This requires smart data structures, techniques, or principles to keep the solution optimized and avoid redundant operations. In the next section, we‚Äôll explore how an unexpected application of Zobrist Hashing, which was originally designed for board games, remarkably addressed this challenge and provided an elegant solution to the problem.

Each bit in the string denoted the parity of the corresponding number (0 for even parity and 1 for odd parity). As I looped through the array, I updated the bit string with each number‚Äôs parity, hashed the resulting configuration, and recorded the counts for each bit representation. The number of distinct pairs of the same bit string indicated the total number of balanced subarrays. This approach, while conceptually simple, suffered from significant space complexity issues, especially when dealing with large input arrays. For example, when the size of the given array reached 50,000 elements, storing the entire configuration as a series of long-type numbers required nearly 391 long-type variables. Managing such a vast representation proved inefficient and impractical, leading to excessively high memory consumption.

It has gained popularity for its simplicity yet strategic depth, making it an intriguing challenge for players of all ages. Rules and Winning Condition of the Game üèÜ Breakthrough is played on an 8x8 square board, although it was originally designed for a 7x7 board, allowing for easy scalability to larger sizes. Each player controls a set of pawns, represented by black and white pieces, and the goal is to outmaneuver the opponent to achieve victory. The game starts with the pawns of both players positioned at opposite ends of the board. The rules are as follows: Piece Movement: Players take turns moving one of their pawns in a forward direction. A pawn can move one square either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, as long as the target square is unoccupied. However, diagonal movement can only be used for capturing an opponent‚Äôs pawn. Capture: If a player‚Äôs pawn lands on a square diagonally adjacent to an opponent‚Äôs pawn, it captures the opponent‚Äôs pawn, removing it from the board. Capturing is an essential tactic for gaining an advantage in the game. Promotion: When a player‚Äôs pawn reaches the opponent‚Äôs home row, it gets promoted to a ‚Äúsuper pawn.‚Äù The super pawn gains additional movement options, allowing it to move both forward and backward one square, adding more strategic possibilities. Winning Conditions üèÜ Breakthrough offers two ways to claim victory: Reaching the Opponent‚Äôs Home Row: The first player to advance one of their pawns to the opponent‚Äôs home row wins the game immediately. This approach emphasizes aggressive and rapid advancement. Eliminating the Opponent‚Äôs Pawns: Alternatively, a player can win by eliminating all of the opponent‚Äôs pawns, leaving them with no legal moves. This approach emphasizes careful planning and tactical precision. The game‚Äôs simplicity belies its complexity, as players must carefully balance offense and defense while predicting their opponent‚Äôs moves. Breakthrough provides an engaging and intellectually stimulating experience, making it a favorite among strategy game enthusiasts. Whether you are a seasoned player or a newcomer, Breakthrough promises a rewarding and enjoyable gaming session.

This combination empowers the agent to intelligently explore the game tree and make strategic decisions based on the evaluation of each board state. Minimax Search Algorithm üåÄ At the core of my AI agent‚Äôs decision-making process is the minimax search algorithm, a fundamental technique used in two-player, zero-sum games like Breakthrough. The algorithm explores the possible moves and outcomes of the game tree to find the best move for the current player, assuming the opponent will make optimal moves. The objective is to maximize the agent‚Äôs evaluation score while minimizing the opponent‚Äôs score. Alpha-Beta Pruning üçÉ To address the computational complexity of the minimax algorithm, especially in games with a large branching factor, I implemented alpha-beta pruning. This intelligent technique prunes or cuts off parts of the game tree that are proven to be irrelevant to the final decision. By reducing the number of nodes explored, alpha-beta pruning significantly improves the efficiency of the search, allowing the AI agent to explore deeper into the game tree within the specified time constraints. The Heuristic Evaluation Function üß† To evaluate the desirability of each board state, I carefully designed a heuristic evaluation function. This function takes into account various factors that influence the value of a particular board state. By assessing the characteristics of the board, the heuristic function aims to approximate the true value of the board state, enabling the AI agent to make informed and strategic decisions. Factors Considered in the Heuristic Function üìä To create a comprehensive evaluation, the heuristic function considers multiple factors: Piece Score: This factor quantifies the difference in the number of black pawns and white pawns on the board. A higher piece score indicates an advantageous position for the black player, as it signifies a greater number of pieces compared to the opponent. Position Score: The position score represents the difference in the sum of distances of each black pawn from its baseline and the sum of distances of white pawns from their baseline. A higher position score implies a better positional advantage for the black player, positioning its pawns closer to achieving the winning condition. Offensive Score: This score reflects the farthest distance from any black pawn to the opponent‚Äôs baseline. A higher offensive score indicates that black pawns are positioned closer to the opponent‚Äôs home row, bringing them closer to victory. Defensive Score: Conversely, the defensive score represents the closest distance from any white pawn to the black pawn‚Äôs baseline. A higher defensive score suggests a stronger defensive position for the black player, safeguarding its pawns from imminent threats. Danger Penalty: The heuristic function penalizes board states where white pawns can attack black pawns in the next turn, as such a situation endangers the black pawns and might lead to potential losses. Protected Bonus: On the other hand, if an endangered black pawn is protected by other black pawns, the heuristic function rewards the state. This strategic move lures the opponent into capturing a pawn that can be immediately counterattacked, turning a potentially adverse situation into an advantageous one. Empty Column Penalty: The heuristic function penalizes boards with empty columns, as they can create difficulties in defense and counterattacks. Empty White Column Penalty: Additionally, the heuristic function doubles the penalization for columns with a white pawn but no black pawn, as this creates a vulnerable position for the black player, inviting potential threats.

A higher danger penalty penalizes the state more heavily, indicating a precarious situation where the black pawns are at risk of being captured. Protected Bonus: The protected bonus becomes instrumental in determining whether an endangered black pawn is being protected by other black pawns. If a black pawn is endangered but protected, we reward the state instead, as it offers the opportunity for a counterattack. This strategic maneuver can be especially effective against opponents that prioritize attacking. Empty Column Penalty: The presence of empty columns on the board complicates defensive and offensive tactics, making it difficult to block opponents on a particular column or launch attacks on neighboring columns. Penalizing boards with empty columns discourages the player from leaving columns without black pawns, promoting better strategic play.

Additionally, to speed up the evaluation process, I implemented memoization in the evaluate_board function. This technique stores the score of each board as a dictionary in the PlayerAI() class, avoiding repeated calls to the evaluate_board function for identical boards at the base cases.

Here‚Äôs the enhanced version with emojis for each point: Enhancements Left Unexplored üöß While the current implementation already demonstrates formidable performance, there are still some enhancements I did not have the time to explore fully: Absolutely! Let‚Äôs delve deeper into each unexplored enhancement: Zobrist Hashing üß©: Zobrist hashing is a clever technique used in board game AI to efficiently represent and compare board states. It involves assigning a random number (a hash value) to each possible piece and position on the board. By XORing these hash values together, we can create a unique hash for each board state. Zobrist hashing allows us to quickly compare and identify previously visited board states, reducing redundant evaluations and improving search efficiency. Implementing this technique could have further optimized the algorithm‚Äôs performance, particularly in scenarios with a high number of board states. Transposition Tables üî¢: Transposition tables are a valuable addition to any advanced board game AI. They store previously computed board evaluations, along with their associated depth and best move information. When encountering a previously visited board state during the search, the AI can retrieve the stored evaluation and use it to update the current evaluation score. This saves time by avoiding redundant evaluations and allows the AI agent to explore deeper levels in the game tree. Opening Book üìö: Creating an opening book involves precomputing and storing a collection of well-known and well-analyzed opening moves. During the early stages of the game, the AI agent can refer to this book to make moves without extensive search, as these moves have been strategically analyzed beforehand. Utilizing an opening book can significantly speed up the early moves, providing the AI with a solid foundation for the rest of the game.

Here are the heuristic functions for these naive players: # Compare the number of pieces def piece_evaluation(board): number_of_pieces = 0 for i in range(6): for j in range(6): if board[i][j] == 'B': number_of_pieces += 1 if board[i][j] == 'W': number_of_pieces -= 1 return number_of_pieces # Compare the number of possible moves def mobility_evaluation(board): invert_state = copy.deepcopy(board) utils.invert_board(invert_state) return len(possible_moves(board)) - len(possible_moves(invert_state)) # Compare the total number of distances from the baseline def greedy_evaluation(board): total_position_score = 0 for i in range(6): for j in range(6): if board[i][j] == 'B': total_position_score += i elif board[i][j] == 'W': total_position_score -= (5 - i) return total_position_score def reckless_evaluation(board): score = 0 for i in range(6): for j in range(6): if board[i][j] == \"B\": score = max(score, i) return score def defensive_evaluation(board): score = 6 for i in range(6): for j in range(6): if board[i][j] == \"W\": score = min(score, i) return score # Heuristic Function: Random Evaluation # This player makes random moves without any strategic evaluation. def random_evaluation(board): return random.randint(-10, 10) # Heuristic Function: Mobility Evaluation # This player prioritizes maximizing its own mobility, irrespective of the opponent's moves. def mobility_evaluation_v2(board): return len(possible_moves(board)) # Heuristic Function: Defensive Recklessness # This player aggressively moves forward but also considers its distance from the opponent's baseline. def defensive_recklessness_evaluation(board): score = 0 for i in range(6): for j in range(6): if board[i][j] == \"B\": score = max(score, i) elif board[i][j] == \"W\": score = max(score, 5 - i) return score # Heuristic Function: Proximity to Victory # This player evaluates positions based on their proximity to winning conditions. def proximity_to_victory_evaluation(board): winning_score = 100 losing_score = -100 black_win, white_win = check_victory(board) if black_win: return winning_score elif white_win: return losing_score else: return 0 By incorporating these additional naive players, my AI agent will now compete against various strategies with different evaluation criteria. This comprehensive testing will help me gain a deeper understanding of its performance and areas for potential improvement. Let the gaming begin! üöÄüéÆ Astounding Results üåü My AI agent demonstrated its mettle by defeating all naive players within approximately 20 steps! The effectiveness and power of minimax search, coupled with an insightful heuristic function, exceeded my expectations. The ability to search several more layers in such a short time showcased the true potential of the iterative deepening minimax algorithm.
