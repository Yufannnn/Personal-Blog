# My First Post! 😉


Hello world! Yufan here! Welcome to my blog, where I'll share my thoughts and experiences on various topics. Let me tell you why I decided to start this blog and what I plan to share here 😊

### Why I Started This Blog 😊

1. **Organizing Knowledge and Experiences:** One of the main reasons for creating this blog is to better structure my knowledge and experiences in words. By doing so, I can easily refer back to them in the future and, at the same time, help others who may find themselves in similar situations.

2. **Improving My English Writing Skills:** As a non-native English speaker, I believe that expressing my thoughts in writing will not only help me improve my English but also enable me to connect with a broader audience. Writing in English challenges me to think more creatively and expand my language abilities.

3. **Connecting with a Global Community:** Through this blog, I hope to connect with people from all around the world who share similar interests. The internet has the power to bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds and cultures, and I'm excited to be a part of this global community.

4. **Documenting Personal Growth:** This blog will be a digital diary of my personal growth journey. As I learn, discover, and encounter new experiences, I want to capture these moments and reflect on them to see how far I've come in my life's journey.

### What I'll Share 📚

Here are the main topics you can expect to find on my blog:

1. **Computer Science:** As a third-year computer science student at the National University of Singapore, I'll share insights and experiences related to my studies and projects in the tech world. From coding challenges to exciting innovations, I'll explore the fascinating realm of computer science.

2. **Kinesiology and Nutriology:** I have a passion for health and fitness, so I'll delve into the fascinating fields of kinesiology and nutriology. I'll share valuable information and tips for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including workout routines, nutrition advice, and the science behind physical well-being.

3. **Living and Studying Abroad:** Having the opportunity to study in a foreign country has been a transformative experience for me. I'll share my experiences, challenges, and adventures of living and studying away from home. From cultural exchanges to overcoming language barriers, I'll document the journey of becoming a global citizen.

### The Style of My Posts 🖋️

My blog posts will have a casual and friendly tone, making them approachable and enjoyable to read. I want my readers to feel like they're having a conversation with a friend. While being informative and educational is my priority, I'll also infuse my personal touch and sense of humor to keep things engaging.
