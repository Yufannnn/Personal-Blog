# First Time Benching 90KG for 6 Reps! 💪


Today was a special day in my fitness journey – I managed to bench press 90KG for 6 reps! 💪 I'm excited to share this milestone with you all, and let's take a moment to celebrate together! 🎉

### A Journey of Ups and Downs 😊

Over the past one and a half years, life threw some challenges my way – with the pandemic and gym restrictions, it wasn't easy to maintain my regular training. But hey, I kept at it! My bench press seemed stuck at 80KG for 3 reps, and the dream of pressing 100KG felt far away. But you know what they say, "slow progress is still progress!" 😉

### Breaking Through the Bottleneck 🚀

This year, things started looking up! With the easing of gym restrictions, I got back into my training groove. Sure, my body fat rate may have gone up a tad (currently around 16%), but my strength made up for it! Today, to my surprise, I bench pressed 90KG for 6 reps! 💥

I couldn't believe it at first, but it's a little victory that has me beaming with pride. The road to pressing 100KG is still ahead, but hey, I'm getting closer! 😎
