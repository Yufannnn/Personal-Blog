### Why I Started Working Out and Bulking 🏋️‍

- 📈 **A Typical Ectomorph:** Standing tall at 1.91m, I used to be a typical ectomorph weighing a mere 72Kg, with an extremely thin appearance. My love for basketball was overshadowed by the constant feeling of being overpowered by stronger players. That's when I decided to take charge, hit the gym, and build more muscle to boost my strength and confidence.

### Not Resting Enough 😴

- 📅 **Overtraining Enthusiasm:** I'll admit, when I first started working out, my passion was off the charts – almost excessive. I was hitting the gym six or even seven times a week! However, I soon realized that this relentless frequency didn't allow my body enough time to rest and recover. Too much passion can sometimes backfire, leaving you feeling drained and fatigued. 😓

  - **Learning to Listen to My Body:** I've come to understand the importance of rest days and the value of allowing my muscles to recover. Nowadays, I ensure I have at least one or two rest days each week, and I actively listen to my body's cues for rest and recovery.

  - **Incorporating Active Recovery:** On rest days, I engage in light activities like walking, yoga, or mobility exercises to keep my body moving without overloading it. Active recovery helps prevent stiffness and promotes blood flow to aid recovery.

  - **Prioritizing Sleep:** Sleep is a crucial aspect of rest and recovery. I now prioritize getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support muscle repair and growth.

### Not Eating Enough Protein and Calories 🍽️

- 🍗 **Clean Eating Obsession:** In terms of diet, I made the mistake of being overly fixated on eating "clean" foods, neglecting the crucial aspect of consuming enough protein and calories. As an ectomorph trying to bulk up, my top priority should have been creating a sufficient calorie surplus and ensuring I get enough protein (at least one gram per KG of body weight) to maximize muscle growth.

  - **Balancing Clean Foods and Caloric Intake:** While I still aim to eat nutrient-dense foods, I've learned to strike a balance by incorporating calorie-dense options like nuts, seeds, and healthy fats to support my muscle-building goals.

  - **Regular Protein Intake:** I now make sure to include a protein source in every meal, such as lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, and plant-based options like tofu and legumes.

  - **Pre and Post-Workout Nutrition:** I pay attention to my pre and post-workout nutrition, ensuring I have a balanced meal before training and a protein-rich snack or shake after to support muscle recovery.

### Skipping Mobility and Flexibility Work 🤸

- 🧘 **Overlooked Flexibility:** In my eagerness for weightlifting and strength training, I neglected the importance of mobility and flexibility exercises. This oversight led to some muscle imbalances and tightness, affecting my overall performance and risking potential injuries. Incorporating stretching and mobility work is now an essential part of my routine.

  - **Warming Up with Dynamic Stretches:** I start my workouts with dynamic stretches to warm up my muscles and increase joint mobility. This helps prevent injuries during lifting.

  - **Post-Workout Stretching:** After each workout, I dedicate time to static stretching, targeting major muscle groups to reduce muscle tension and improve flexibility.

  - **Yoga for Recovery:** I've incorporated yoga sessions into my weekly routine to further enhance flexibility, improve posture, and promote relaxation.

### Ignoring the Importance of Sleep 😴

- 🛌 **Sleep Deprivation Mistake:** In my pursuit of gains, I often sacrificed sleep, thinking I could make up for it with sheer determination. Oh, how wrong I was! Sleep is a vital component of muscle recovery and growth. I've learned the hard way that quality sleep is as crucial as hitting the gym when it comes to making progress.

  - **Establishing a Sleep Routine:** I now maintain a consistent sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on weekends.

  - **Creating a Relaxing Bedtime Ritual:** I wind down before sleep with calming activities like reading, meditation, or listening to soothing music to signal to my body that it's time to rest.

  - **Minimizing Screen Time:** I avoid screens and electronic devices at least an hour before bedtime to reduce exposure to blue light, which can interfere with sleep.

### Overlooking Proper Form and Technique 🏋️‍♂️

- 🏋️‍ **Compromised Form for Weights:** In my eagerness to lift heavier weights, I sometimes compromised on proper form and technique. This not only limited my gains but also put me at risk of injury. I've since prioritized learning correct lifting techniques and performing exercises with a focus on form rather than just weight.

  - **Hiring a Trainer:** I sought guidance from a qualified trainer to learn proper form for various exercises. The trainer's feedback and correction have been invaluable in improving my technique.

  - **Starting with Lower Weights:** I humbled myself and started with lower weights to master the movements and build a solid foundation before increasing the load.

  - **Filming My Workouts:** I occasionally record my workouts to review my form and identify areas for improvement. This self-assessment has been a great tool for fine-tuning my lifts.

### Comparing My Progress to Others 📊

- 🤔 **Avoiding Comparison Trap:** It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others, especially with social media showcasing impressive transformations. This led me to feel demotivated and doubtful of my own progress. I've now embraced the mantra "progress over perfection" and focus on my journey without comparing it to others.

  - **Appreciating My Progress:** Instead of seeking external validation, I celebrate my own progress, no matter how small. Every personal record, no matter how minor, is a victory worth acknowledging.

  - **Learning from Others:** Rather than comparing, I draw inspiration from others' journeys and use them as motivation to keep pushing myself forward.

  - **Focusing on Personal Goals:** I've set clear and achievable personal goals that align with my fitness aspirations. By focusing on my objectives, I remain committed and undistracted by external benchmarks.

### Not Tracking Progress and Setbacks 📈

- 📓 **Importance of a Training Journal:** In the beginning, I didn't keep track of my workouts and progress, which made it challenging to gauge improvements or identify setbacks. Now, I maintain a training journal, jotting down my workouts, weights, and how I feel during each session. This helps me adjust my approach and stay motivated.

  - **Measuring Progress:** Regularly recording my lifts and exercises allows me to track my strength gains and ensure I'm progressively challenging myself.

  - **Analyzing Setbacks:** When encountering setbacks, I use my training journal to review possible contributing factors and make adjustments to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

  - **Motivation from Past Achievements:** Looking back on past achievements in my journal reminds me of how far I've come, providing motivation to keep striving for more.
