            </div><div class="content" id="content"><p>Last week, I completed my journey as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in the School of Computing. This role has been a valuable and rewarding experience, and I want to share my journey as a TA, including how I got the position and the insights I gained from this opportunity. 🎓</p>
<h3 id="the-module-i-taught">The Module I Taught</h3>
<p>I served as a TA for the module <strong>CS1101S Programming Methodology</strong>. 🖥️</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CS1101S introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem-solving. It serves as the first and foremost introductory module to computing. 🚀</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-i-became-a-teaching-assistant">How I Became a Teaching Assistant</h3>
<h5 id="background">Background</h5>
<p>CS1101S is a foundational module that every Computer Science student is expected to take, except for those who have been exempted. Due to its importance, the cohort size is significant, with approximately 700 students each year. To ensure better class engagement, the class size is kept small, with around eight students per class. Consequently, the module requires a large number of Teaching Assistants to support the students effectively. The professors open a recruitment portal to select the Teaching Assistants for CS1101S, distinguishing it from the application process of many other modules. 🎓</p>
<h5 id="application-procedure">Application Procedure</h5>
<p>The TA recruitment portal typically opens around November and December. Besides basic personal particulars, the application requires candidates to elaborate on the characteristics of a good teaching assistant and the personal qualities they possess that make them suitable for the role. After the application submission, the professors arrange interview sessions in the subsequent semester for shortlisted candidates. 📝</p>
<h5 id="the-interview">The Interview</h5>
<p>The interview usually takes place from January to April in the second semester. The interview is quite formal and aims to test the candidates&rsquo; ability to express themselves clearly and their comprehension of CS1101S concepts. The professor may act as a confusing student and ask the candidates to explain various concepts, such as recursion, environment model, time complexity, and more. 💬</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Unexpected Questions: During the interview, the professor might ask unexpected conceptual questions. For instance, I was asked about the difference between a statement and an expression, a seemingly straightforward yet often overlooked distinction. 🤔</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interview typically lasts for about half an hour, and the passing rate is generally high. It is essential to note that an A- grade in CS1101S does not hinder one from getting an offer as a Teaching Assistant. 🎯</p>
<h3 id="workload-and-responsibilities">Workload and Responsibilities</h3>
<p>The workload as a Teaching Assistant varies depending on one&rsquo;s familiarity with the module&rsquo;s content and preferred teaching style. It primarily consists of three aspects: conducting lessons, preparing lessons, and grading homework. 📚</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Conducting Lessons</strong>: There is a 2-hour tutorial session every week. During the session, I typically start with a lecture recap for around 20-30 minutes, followed by students discussing their homework among themselves. Next, I provide an in-class worksheet for them to solve on the spot, with the remaining time dedicated to explaining the solutions. The workload of conducting lessons is generally manageable, especially when actively guiding the students through most of the content. However, some Teaching Assistants prefer to adopt a more hands-off approach and encourage students to engage more actively in discussions. 🎒</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preparing Lessons</strong>: The workload of preparing lessons is surprisingly significant. Being able to teach effectively requires a deeper understanding of the subject matter than simply knowing the concepts. As a result, I formed a small group with four friends who also became TAs for this module. We met every Friday to plan our lessons, discuss challenging concepts, and create slides for the upcoming tutorials. Instead of starting from scratch, we adapted slides from the previous batch of TAs and adjusted them to fit the modifications in the syllabus. 📊</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grading Homework</strong>: Grading homework requires a great deal of patience, as CS1101S is an introductory module, and many students have little to no programming experience. The coding style of their homework can be quite messy, and some students lack the habit of commenting their code, making it challenging to understand their solutions. However, as the semester progresses, students become more familiar with coding and computer science, which improves the grading experience. 📝</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, being a Teaching Assistant for CS1101S can be compared to taking a challenging module in terms of workload and responsibilities. 💼</p>
<h3 id="insights-and-skills-gained">Insights and Skills Gained</h3>
<p>Being a Teaching Assistant provided me with valuable experiences and insights: 🌟</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reinforced Understanding of Fundamental CS Concepts</strong>: As a TA, I discovered that my understanding of certain concepts from the previous year was not as comprehensive as I had thought. Explaining concepts to students requires a deeper level of understanding, motivating me to study those fundamentals in greater depth. 📘</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Public Speaking</strong>: As a non-native English speaker, I had limited confidence in my spoken English. However, this opportunity allowed me to speak in public regularly, which significantly improved my ability to communicate effectively. 🗣️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Boosted Confidence</strong>: Being responsible for guiding a group of students was not only a duty but also a validation of my abilities and efforts throughout the year. This experience boosted my confidence and provided a positive impact in various aspects of my life. 🚀</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compensation-">Compensation 😋</h3>
<p>The compensation for being a TA consists of two parts: contact hours and non-contact hours, each at a rate of $40 per hour. Typically, I had 2 contact hours and 2 non-contact hours per week. Additional hours could be earned through tasks like invigilating exams and facilitating forum hours. The payment is reasonable and can cover my accommodation fees at Prince George&rsquo;s Park Residence. 💰</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ Relatively High Workload: While the payment is standard across different modules in the School of Computing, it&rsquo;s essential to note that being a TA for CS1101S might entail a relatively higher workload compared to other modules. Therefore, if one is seeking the position solely for financial reasons, it may not be the ideal choice. ⚠️</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, my experience as a Teaching Assistant for CS1101S was both valuable</p>
<p>and rewarding. It provided me with opportunities for personal growth, a deeper understanding of computer science concepts, improved public speaking skills, and boosted confidence. The journey as a TA has been enriching, and I look forward to exploring further avenues for growth in the future. 🌱🤝</p>
