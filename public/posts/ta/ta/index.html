<p><strong>CS1101S Programming Methodology</strong>

            <div class="admonition-content">This module introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem solving, and is the first and foremost introductory module to computing.</div>
        </div>
    </div></p>
<h3 id="how-did-i-even-get-the-position">How Did I Even Get the Position</h3>
<h5 id="background">Background</h5>
<p>Since CS1101S is essentially the first module that every Computer Science Student are supposed to take, except for those who have been exempted from this module, we have a really large cohort size, apporximately 700 student every year. Also, the professors of CS1101S believe that the size of the class should be kept small, less than or equals to eight students per class, for better class engagement. Therefore, they are also recruiting a large number of Teaching Assistants every year. Unlikely most other modules, where we have to apply via the SOC Manpower System or explicitly sending emails to the professor, CS1101s professors will open an portal to recruit Teaching Assistants.</p>
<h5 id="application-procedure">Application Procedure</h5>
<p>The portal will normally be open around November and December. Apart from basic information, like personal particulars, they will ask you to write about what characteristics a good teaching assistant should possess and what personal qualities you possess that could make you a good teaching assistant in the future. After the application, the professors will arrange an interview sesson in the subsequent sememster, if they are satified with the portfolio.</p>
<h5 id="the-interview">The Interview</h5>
<p>The interview can happen anytime from January to Apirl in the second sememster and the style of the interview is quite formal. The professor essentially wants to test whether I was able to express myself clearly and whether I know the concept of CS1101S thoroughly. The profess would pretend to be a confusing student and ask you to explain certain concepts, like recursion, environment model, time complexity and etc.</p>
<div class="details admonition warning open">
        <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
            <i class="icon fas fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>Unexpected Questions<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content">the professor may ask very unexpected question, not difficult questions but some conceptual ones that people tend to neglect. The first question he asked me is the difference between a statment and an expression. 😧</div>
        </div>
    </div>
<p>The interview usually take place for half an hour and I heard that the passing rate is also very high. Don&rsquo;t worry if you didn&rsquo;t get an A for this module, it is perfectly possible to get an offer as Teaching Assistant with an A- grade.</p>
<h3 id="workload-">Workload? 🤔</h3>
<p>I would said it varies large from person to person. I depends on how familiar your are with the content of the module and what style you want the tutorial to be. The workload maingly consists of three parts: conducting lessons, preparing lessons, and grading homework.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>conducting lessons</strong></em>: There is a <em><strong>2-hour tutorial every week</strong></em>. I would first conduct a lecture recap for aroudn 20-30 minutes then let the students discuss their homework among themselve. Afterwards, I will release a in-class worksheet to let them try on the spot for another 20 minutes and explained the results for the remaining time. Personally, I feel that the workload of conducting lessons was actually quite manageable among others. Additionally, I conducted the lessons in such a way, where I will be explaining most of the stuff. I know some of the TA prefer to let the students themselves to speak more.</li>
<li><em><strong>preparing lessons</strong></em>: the workload of preparing lessons are surprisingly high. Although I took the module only one year ago and I have learnt much throughout the year, it is only when I start to be TA that I realized that being able to teach others requires <em><strong>a much higher level understanding of the knowledge</strong></em>. Luckily, I have a small group of 4 friends, who become TAs together with me this sememster. We met every Friday to plan out our lessons, discuss the concepts that we, ourselves, were not sure about, and make the slides for next weeks&rsquo;s lesson. We did not make the slides from scratch as the workload is going to be insane. We most adapted from our TA&rsquo;s slides of the previous batch, and adjusted them to fit the modification of new syllabus</li>
<li><em><strong>grading homework</strong></em>: This is where <em><strong>a lot of patience is needed</strong></em>. We have multiply coding homework to grade every week on a platform for this module, called Source Academy. Since this is introductory module for CS, many students have little to no knowledge to programming. The approach and styling of their homework can be <em><strong>very very messy</strong></em> and most of them don&rsquo;t have a habit of commenting their code. 😕 It gave me a headache reading their code and trying to guess what they are supposed to do in the first few weeks. It did get much better in the second half of the semester where students are much familar with coding and computer science in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, personally, I do feel that the workload of being a Teaching Assistant for this module is comparable to <em><strong>taking a hardcore module myself</strong></em>.</p>
<h3 id="experience-and-skills-i-gain-from-it">Experience and Skills I Gain from it</h3>
<p>By now, you may have the question that given the workload of it, it is even worthy to be a TA and why do I want to be a TA in the first place? My answer is definite! Yes! 😆 I have gained my invaluable experiences thoughout the whole process!</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Reinforce my Understanding of Fundamental CS Concept</strong></em>: When being the Teaching Assistant year, I found that my understanding of many concepts last year was not adequate. For concept like continuation passing style, memoized streams, and Meta-Circular Evaluator. Although I managed to do many of the questions correctly in the exam, I did not genuinely know what is going on. This year, I have to anticipate the weird questions that student might ask me, which server a motivation for me study those fundamentals in a even deper level.</li>
<li><em><strong>Sharpen My Ability to Speak in Public</strong></em>: As a non-native English speaker, I was always not that confident about my speakon English. This opportunity of being Teaching Assistant gives me a chance to regularly speak in public every week. I did feel that when it came to the end of the semester, speaking English becomes more and more natural to me 😇</li>
<li><em><strong>Greatly Boost My Confidence</strong></em>: The responsibility of being a tutor to a small group of people is a duty but also a great acknowledgement of my ability and all the efforst that I made throughout the year. When I went for the interview of the application of a student tutor in Raffles Baording School, I felt much confident when elaborating my stregths to the teachers. (btw, luckily, I also manage to get the offer for that job 😉)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="and-of-course-the-payment-">And, Of Course, The Payment 😋</h3>
<p>The payment consist of two parts: contact hours and non-contact hours both $40 per hour. Every week, I would have 2 contact hours and 2 non-contact hours and of course, you can get additional hours for invigilating exams and facilitating forum hours etc. The payment is not too much but also not too little; it can roughly cover my accomadation fee in Prince George&rsquo;s Park Residence. 😌</p>

            <div class="admonition-content">The payment in SOC is pretty standard, $40 per hour, across different modules. I have compared with my friends, who are Teaching Assistant for other modules, and found that CS1101s TA do have relatively higher workload than other. Therefore, it may not be a wise choice to be CS1101S TA, if you are coming for the money alone 😳</div>
