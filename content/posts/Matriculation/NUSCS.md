Welcome to my post, where I share my experience of getting accepted into NUS Computer Science and being awarded the prestigious S&T Merit Scholarship. This journey might be especially relevant for international students studying in Singapore. 🌍✈️

### My Background 🌟

I hail from China and had the incredible opportunity to come to Singapore six years ago on a government scholarship, the MOE school-based scholarship (SM1 Scholarship), after completing my secondary education in China. I attended Xinmin Secondary School for my secondary education and Eunoia Junior College for my pre-university education.

It's essential to note that NUS may treat individuals from different backgrounds (Singaporeans, PRs, or International Students) differently. Given my unique background, the information in this post may not apply to everyone but can serve as a helpful reference.

### My A Level Results 📚

| Subject                     | Grade |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| H1 General Paper            | A     |
| H2 Mathematics              | A     |
| H2 Further Mathematics      | A     |
| H2 Physics                  | A     |
| H2 China Studies in Chinese | A     |
| H1 Project Work             | B     |
| H3 Mathematics              | Merit |

As indicated by the official cutoff point of NUS Computer Science (AAA/A for 10th percentile and AAA/A for 90th percentile), obtaining 3 A grades for H2 subjects and 1 A grade for H1 subject is crucial. It's worth mentioning that I've heard from a friend who got accepted into CS with an 87.5 rank point despite having a C in General Paper. So, if you're not too confident in General Paper or have scored a B in Project Work like me, don't worry too much! 😏

### About My Scholarship 🏅

I received my offer to NUS Computer Science around March 2021 and was thrilled to receive the offer for the Science and Technology Scholarship just two weeks later. The process didn't involve any interviews or additional application forms.

##### Common Questions Answered 💡

Here are some questions I had when applying last year, and I hope my answers can shed some light on the process:

1. **Do I Need Leadership Experience to Get the S&T Scholarship?**
   - Not necessarily. I didn't have many leadership positions in JC, apart from being a subject representative.

2. **Will There Be an Interview for the Scholarship?**
   - As far as I know and from information obtained from seniors, for applicants with 87.5 rank points and above, NUS offers the S&T scholarship without an interview. However, for those with rank points between 85 and 87.5, an interview may be arranged.

I hope this information proves helpful to aspiring applicants! Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and the best thing you can do is give it your best shot. The right opportunities will find you. 🌈✨
